The first emotion denotes the&nbsp;current state; the second emotion denotes the&nbsp;next emotional state. You task is to estimate&nbsp;the likelihood of a person feeling the first emotion later feeling the second emotion. For this example, what is the chance of a person currently feeling Tired next feeling Excited?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Tired&nbsp;→&nbsp;Excited</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>You will make your rating on a scale from 0-100%, where 0% means that there is zero chance that a person feeling tired will feel excited next, and where 100% means that a person feeling tired now will definitely feel excited next.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Click here to continue.</strong></p>";

But does the human brain make this distinction when we think about the minds of others? That is, do our brains respond differently when we think about a friend feeling upset by a math problem versus that same friend reasoning about a math problem?&nbsp;Neuroscientists have a good understanding of how the brain responds to thinking about other people, however, little is known about how the brain organizes this knowledge of mental states (e.g., happiness, sadness, thinking).&nbsp;&nbsp;The data that you provided today will allow us to generate a stimuli set that will be presented to participants in a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner.&nbsp; Our aim is to begin to understand how the brain organizes our knowledge of mental states.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span 16px;">For background on this research, you can read the paper:</span></p><p><span 16px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Tamir, D.I.*, Thornton, M.A.*, Contreras, J.M., Mitchell, J.P.
